1. Overview
===========

CCSS is a preprocessor/pretty-printer for CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
It extends the CSS language with support for basic arithmetic operations
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) in expressions.  The
programme reads the CSS source from stdin and outputs its result on stdout.
As an example, given the following input:

  h1
	{
	width: 2 * (10em + 5em);
	}

CCSS will produce the following output:

  h1
	{
	width: 30em;
	}

Moreover, CCSS performs a basic dimensionality analysis of each operation,
ensuring the result is consistent.


2. Dependencies
===============

Menhir is used as the parser generator [1], while scanning is done with Ulex [2].
Another requirement is Pcre-ocaml [3].


3. Building and installing
==========================

The build system relies on Ocamlbuild.  Enter 'make' in the 'src' directory
for building the bytecode and native binaries.


4. License
==========
