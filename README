=========================================================================

1. Overview
===========

CCSS is a preprocessor/pretty-printer for CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
It extends the CSS language with support for declaration of variables and
basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
The programme is supposed to be used as a filter: it reads the CSS source
from stdin and outputs its result on stdout.


2. Features
===========

2.1. Variables
==============

With CCSS, you may declare and use variables in your CSS code (in fact, CCSS
variables are actually constants, since they are assigned upon declaration and
may not be changed).  Variable identifiers must begin with an uppercase letter,
and be followed by any combination of letters, numbers, and the characters '-'
(dash) and '_' (underscore).  The value assigned to a variable may be any
CSS expression (including expressions augmented with arithmetic operators,
as described in the next section), as the code below demonstrates:

Foo: 20em;
Bar: 1px solid black;

h1	{
	width: Foo;
	border: Bar;
	}


2.2. Arithmetic
===============

CCSS extends CSS expressions with basic arithmetic operations (addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division).  The operands must be CSS
quantities (either dimensionless or with an attached unit), or other
expressions that ultimately resolve into a quantity.  Moreover, variables
whose value is a quantity (or an expression which resolves into a quantity)
may also be used as operand.

The operators are '+', '-', '*', and 'รท'.  Note that multiplication and
division have precedence over addition and subtraction, but you may use
parentheses to group operations.  Consider thus the following input:

Left: 10em;
Right: 5em;
Total: Left + Right;

h1	{
	padding: (1.5em + 0.5em) * 2;
	width: 2 * Total;
	}


CCSS will produce the following output:

h1
	{
	padding: 4em;
	width: 30em;
	}


The reader will have noticed that CCSS is unit-aware when performing arithmetic.
In fact, the programme performs a basic sanity check of units, and will complain
if you try, for example, to add "1em" with "10px".  On the other hand, CCSS is
also oblivious to the quantities represented by the units, and will also complain
if you try to add "1cm" with "1mm".


3. Dependencies
===============

Menhir is used as the parser generator [1], while scanning is done with Ulex [2].
Another requirement is Pcre-ocaml [3].


4. Building and installing
==========================

The build system relies on Ocamlbuild.  Enter 'make' in the 'src' directory
for building the bytecode and native binaries.
